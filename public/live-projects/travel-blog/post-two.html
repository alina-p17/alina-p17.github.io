          Doesn&#8217;t just seeing its dreamy name give you the travel bug? I
          think the Maldives may be the buzziest destination around the world
          right now. And it&#8217;s not hard to see why. It&#8217;s a country
          that&#8217;s 99% water and only 1% land, made up of 1200 islands (only
          200 of which are inhabited), and many thriving coral reefs. The ocean
          is a brighter turquoise blue than anywhere in the world, and the
          overwater resorts take luxury to a whole new level. While 10 or 20
          years ago, only the elitest of the elite would have even heard about
          the Maldives, let alone gotten the chance to visit and see it in
          person, today we see pictures of this paradise flooding our Instagram
          feeds every single day, and every single photo makes you wonder
          &#8211; could this place really be on earth?

        <h3>What are the best resorts in the Maldives?</h3>
        <p class="post-two-p">
          If I wrote a blog post on the very best hotels in the world,
          there&#8217;s no doubt that Six Senses Laamu would be on my list. This
          perfect island paradise was a huge highlight of my trip to the
          Maldives. Everything is perfect about Six Senses, from the natural
          paradise vibe, to the world-class food (their dinners are great, but
          their over-the-top breakfast buffet and complimentary homemade ice
          cream bar were the best things ever), to the villas that make it hard
          to ever leave your room! (I highly recommend upgrading to a pool
          villa, if you&#8217;re like me and a sucker for dreamy infinity
          pools), to the adorable island bikes you use to get around (that are
          personalized with your initials if &#8217;re a repeating guest!), to
          all of the incredible activities there are to do on the island, from
          snorkeling to sailing to surfing (the Six Senses&#8217; type of
          surfing is often called “luxury surfing”, because they boast some of
          the best waves, but you&#8217;ll often be the only one surfing them, a
          luxury priceless to most surfers).

        <h3>What&#8217;s the food like in the Maldives?</h3>
        <p class="post-two-p">
          The food is SO GOOD IN THE MALDIVES!!!! Of course it depends on the
          resort you choose, but if you choose a luxury resort, you can rest
          assured you&#8217;re going to&#8217;re getting incredible local
          cuisine (read: coconut, tuna and other underwater delicacies), and
          when it&#8217;s not possible to grow or fish something locally, the
          best of the best is imported to the resorts, such as European
          charcuterie, german sausages, French cheeses and Swiss chocolate.
        </p>
        <h3>Will I get bored in the Maldives?</h3>
        <p class="post-two-p">
          No!!! I think this is one of the biggest misconceptions about the
          Maldives. People worry about getting “island fever” and not having
          enough to do for a week on an island. If you&#8217;re staying at one
          of the resorts I recommended, trust me, you are going to have ENDLESS
          activities to do and keep you busy (if you want to!). From snorkeling
          and diving, to paddleboarding and sailing and all the watersports, to
          biking, tennis, movie nights, cooking classes, wine tastings, and
          sunset dolphin cruises. I was having so much fun doing everything on
          the islands that I didn&#8217;t even have a chance to touch my book
          that I bought for the trip!!!
