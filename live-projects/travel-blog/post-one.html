        <p>
          Jordan is all about discovering the unexpected. Surprises await around
          every corner in this fascinating and adventurous country. Unearthed
          ruins provide a spectacular window into an extraordinary past. A past
          so old and intriguing, it has inspired many a legend or movie setting.
        </p>
        <h2 class="main-h2">LOST CITIES</h2>
        <p>
          The lost city of Petra is one of the most breathtaking scenes of all
          time. One of the seven wonders of the world, the ancient city emerges
          from rose-colored stone, and steep gorges. The treasury of Petra is
          the most famous, for its mammoth pillars carved into the rock, and
          it&#8217;s electrifying presence. Visit in the day to truly appreciate
          its beauty, and in the night to witness hundreds of candles burning
          outside- a spine-tingling moment that entirely lives up to the hype.
        </p>

        <h2 class="main-h2">JEWELS OF JORDAN</h2>
        <p>
          Petra may be the gem of Jordan, but there are far more treasures to
          reveal. For example, Wadi Rum, &#8217;the valley of the moon,&#8217;
          is a stunning, red rippled desert lying on the edge of Jordan.
          Experience the colors of the sand as they change between pink, red,
          and orange from dawn until dusk, or the crisp night sky shining with
          dazzling stars. Trek through the dunes, to discover canyons and
          imposing rocks, decorated with inscriptions and drawings from ancient
          settlers. It is this beauty that led Lawrence of Arabia himself to
          describe it as &#8217;godlike.&#8217; For a final sparkling surprise,
          head to the coastal jewel of Aqaba. Here, a snorkeling heaven of
          turquoise, glassy ocean, sandy beaches, and orange mountainous scenery
          await. All this breathtaking scenery, and fascinating history, are
          waiting to be unearthed by adventurers in Jordan!
